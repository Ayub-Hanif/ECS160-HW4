- https://piazza.com/class/m4a9mvpz8fg6rm/post/101: You can assume that there is always a default constructor that requires no arguments for every persistable object and get it using the getDeclaredConstructor() method.
- https://piazza.com/class/m4a9mvpz8fg6rm/post/98: However, if you're designing your persistence framework correctly it should require zero additional effort to support nested lazy loading. Your solution should support persisting subclasses/superclasses. You should use the correct Reflection API to access the superclass fields and methods.
